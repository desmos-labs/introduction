## Summary

Desmos [ˈdɛsmɒs] is a public blockchain for social media applications built with Cosmos SDK and Tendermint. It is similar to Cosmos Hub with different staking and minting modules. The first module of Desmos is Magpie, which provides identity and accountability to validators, delegators and other types of stakeholders with a novel and generalizable temporary key pair using browser-based WASM. Desmos will gradually include more modules specifically designed for decentralized social networking and digital advertising applications. It will also serve as a regional Hub in South China and Southeast Asia and a testbed of different interesting parameters and governance method.

Initially, we will bootstrap the early users of Desmos by building a decentralized microblogging platform on top of Big Dipper to solve one pain point: the existing and new Cosmonauts do not have a way to know each other through a decentralized and verifiable manner. As Big Dipper is one of the most popular block explorers for Cosmos ecosystem chains, many people who are interested in Cosmos will definitely visit Big Dipper. A decentralized microblogging platform secured by validators is an interesting way for Cosmonauts to connect. 

After experiencing various blockchain projects, we hope to make Desmos a “validators first” project. We believe engaging validators are crucial to the success of Desmos, as they are not only our security guards but also our community builders. This is particularly important to a social network-specific chain like Desmos. We will design our incentivized program and fundraiser to reflect this “validators first” philosophy.
